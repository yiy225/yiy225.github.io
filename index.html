        <p>The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let us get started with GitHub!</p>

        <p class=paragraph2>GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects. You do not have to worry about losing data on your hard drive or managing a project across multiple computers. Most importantly, GitHub is a collaborative and asynchronous workflow for building software better, together.

This guide walks you through the GitHub Essentials: Repositories, Branches, Commits, Issues and Pull Requests.</p>

        <p>With these skills, you will go far. And with this hello-world repository you will have a place to store ideas, resources or other general notes, even discuss things with others.</p>
